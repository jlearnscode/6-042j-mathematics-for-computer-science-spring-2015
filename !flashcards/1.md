>    proposition

statement, either T or F
>    $$\forall$$
For all
>    $$\natnums$$
nonnegative integers (\natnums)
>    $$\in$$
is IN, is a member of, belongs to (\in)
>    $$\Z^+$$
positive integers (\Z^+)

Not equal (\neq) or (osx: option(⌥) + =)

>    predicate
proposition T/F depends on >1 variables
Usually P(n), with ::= (\coloncolonequals)
Looks like function, but NOT! just T/F!

>    axiom
propositions that are simply accepted as true (like geometry propositions, middle school) Started from Euclid

>    proof
sequence of logical deductions from axioms/previous proofs

>    theorems
important true propositions

>    lemma
preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions

>    corollary

proposition related to theorem (just a few logical steps from theorem)

above definitions are not set in stone/precise, sometimes lemma >>>> theorem in importance

>    axiomatic theory

from geometry, Euclid's method of axiom and proof

>    Zermelo-Faenkel with Choice (ZFC) axioms

can prove ~all math w/ these and a few logical deduction rules!

> "in the midst of a proof, you may start to wonder, “Must I prove this little fact or can I take it as an axiom?” There really is no absolute answer, since what’s reasonable to assume and what requires proof depends on the circumstances and the audience. A good general guideline is simply to be up front about what you’re assuming."

>   inference rules
Logical deductions, used to prove new props from ones prev proved
MUST BE SOUND (logically true)

>   $$modus \ ponens$$
fundamental inference rule: proof of P w/ proof that P IMPLIES Q = proof of Q
$$\frac {P,\quad P\ implies\ Q}{Q}$$

> antecedent
Statement(s) above line, if proved, leads to conclusion

> consequent, conclusion
Statement(s) below line, consider also proved if above line is proved

> sound
Assigning true, logical

> "As with axioms, we will not be too formal about the set of legal inference rules. Each step in a proof should be clear and “logical”; in particular, you should state what previously proved facts are used to derive each new conclusion."

>   Implication: $$(P\ implies\ Q)$$
Proposition in the form "If P, then Q"
Howto: 1. "assume P" 2. prove that Q follows

>Things that apply to all proofs:
1. You’ll often need to do some scratchwork while you’re trying to figure out the logical steps of a proof. Your scratchwork can be as disorganized as you like—full of dead-ends, strange diagrams, obscene words, whatever. But keep your scratchwork separate from your final proof, which should be clear
and concise.
2. typically begin with the word “Proof” and end with some sort of delimiter like ⇤ or “QED.” Just to clarify where proofs begin and end.

>   Proof methods
1. Howto: 1. "assume P" 2. prove that Q follows
2. prove contrapositive
<br>Howto: 1. "we prove the contrapositive:" _(state contrapositive)_  2. then method ___1___

>implication $$“P\ IMPLIES\ Q”$$ is logically equivalent to its contrapositive
>$$NOT(Q)\ IMPLIES\ NOT(P)\:$$
>Proving one == proving the other; proving the contrapositive is sometimes easier!

>   rational (math)<br>
when it equals a quotient of integers: if it equals _m / n_ for some integers _m_ and _n_
[ratio'd]

> Proving "iff" <br>e.g. $$P\ iff\ Q$$
1. prove forwards AND backwards implications
2. Construct chain of iffs, connecting P to Q
